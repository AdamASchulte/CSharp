MinHeap- A min heap implementation found online. My first program in C#. Employs a generic type for the swap method, and ref keyword to pass the variables by reference rather than by value.
There was a missing line in the extract min function that I added at line 111. I added a little bit of user input just for the sake of it.
Run using: dotnet run
